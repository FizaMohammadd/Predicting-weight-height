# Predicting Weight from Height Using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model that predicts a person's weight based on their height. The implementation is done in **Google Colab** using Python and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

## 📌 Overview

- **Objective:** To build and evaluate a linear regression model for predicting weight from height.
- **Data:** A synthetic dataset containing height and weight values.
- **Tools:** Google Colab, Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
